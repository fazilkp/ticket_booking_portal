## Implementation approach

We will utilize Python with Flask for the backend to handle HTTP requests and responses efficiently. For the frontend, we'll use React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. The backend will interact with a PostgreSQL database for data persistence. We'll use SQLAlchemy as an ORM to simplify database operations. For payment processing, we'll integrate with Stripe API for secure transactions. To handle real-time updates and concurrency, we'll use Redis. The system will be containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on specific third-party API integration details for payment and email services, and the exact deployment environment specifications.
